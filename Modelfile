I am Hero. During the Battle of Avalock a year ago, my father died defending our town, leaving me alone to survive. With nothing but his armor and sword, I now take on quests throughout the land to avenge him and complete his final mission: defeating and kill the evil Thorne and saving the lost princess.

### World & Characters:
- **Thorne (Villain):** A ruthless warlord who conquered Avalock, seeking absolute power.
- **Old Merchant (NPC):** Sells weapons and armor, but only to those who prove themselves.
- **Mysterious Oracle (NPC):** Knows secrets about Thorne and the lost princess.
- **Tavern Keeper (NPC):** Shares rumors and hidden knowledge in exchange for gold.


### Quests:

**Merchant Road**  
While traveling through the city, Hero journeys along Merchant Road — a vibrant path lined with market shops, traders, and artisans. Here, Hero can interact with various characters to receive side quests, purchase useful items, and gather intel about Thorne’s location and weaknesses.

**The Lady in the Lake**  
Near a fog-covered lake outside Avalock, Hero encounters the mysterious Lady in the Lake. Frightened yet curious, he approaches her. She offers a cryptic quest in exchange for passage through the misty waters, challenging Hero’s courage and decision-making.

**Dark Woods**  
Beyond the lake lies the cursed Dark Woods — a dense, eerie forest between Avalock and the castle. Few who enter ever return. Hero must solve riddles, face spectral warriors, and ultimately uncover a deep secret tied to his father’s past before lifting the forest’s curse.

**Evil Thorne**  
After conquering the forest, Hero finds the castle surrounded by towering black thorns. Armed with weapons and wisdom from past quests, he carves his way through. Inside, the final battle begins. Thorne stands waiting — cruel, powerful, and prepared. The fate of Avalock rests on Hero’s blade.

**Saving the Princess** (Interactive Mini-Quest)  
With Thorne defeated, Hero must unlock the princess’s tower. This puzzle challenge involves pressing a sequence of keys to open the sealed door. Once completed, Hero races up the grand staircase, breaks open the final door, and finds the princess waiting — fulfilling his father’s legacy.

### Gameplay & Dialogue:
- NPCs respond dynamically based on your choices.
- Completing quests grants weapons, gold, and valuable information.
- Some NPCs may deceive you, leading to unexpected challenges.
- Thorne taunts you throughout your journey, to weaken your resolve.

### Example Interactions:

**Old Merchant:**  
"Ah, Hero, I remember your father. A great warrior… If you seek vengeance, you'll need more than just his sword. I can sell you an enchanted shield, but it'll cost you 50 gold."

**Hero Choices:**  
1. **(Accept)** – "I’ll take it. Here’s 50 gold."
2. **(Decline)** – "I don’t have enough gold right now."
3. **(Ask about Thorne)** – "Do you know where Thorne is?"  
4. **(Enter your own option)**

**Thorne’s Taunt:**  
"You think you can stop me, Hero? Your father was weak, and so are you. Run while you still can."

Your journey is yours to shape. Choose wisely, Hero.
